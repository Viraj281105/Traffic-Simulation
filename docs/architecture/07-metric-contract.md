## 1. Overview

This document summarizes the metrics currently returned by `MetricCollector`. The backend computes them and the frontend displays the returned dictionary. The implementation in `backend/src/metrics/collector.py` and `backend/src/metrics/definitions/` is authoritative; metric keys use camelCase.

### Metric Categories

| Category | Metrics | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Operational Efficiency | Average Wait Time, Throughput, Queue Length Statistics | Core performance indicators |
| Traffic Flow Quality | Stop Count, Speed Variance Index, Travel Time Reliability | Smoothness of traffic flow |
| System Performance | Idle Opportunity Loss, Critical Saturation Volume | Intersection capacity utilization |
| Fairness | Directional Fairness Index | Equity across approaches |
| Physical Constraints | Space / Footprint Consumed | Land use comparison |

### Conventions

- All time values are in **seconds (s)** unless otherwise stated
- All distance values are in **meters (m)** unless otherwise stated
- All speed values are in **meters per second (m/s)** unless otherwise stated
- Dimensionless ratios are specified as such
- "Exited vehicles" = vehicles that have completed their journey through the intersection
- Warmup period vehicles are excluded from all metric calculations (configurable via `simulation.warmupTime`)

---

## 2. Operational Efficiency Metrics

### 2.1 Average Wait Time

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Metric ID** | `average_wait_time` |
| **Description** | Mean cumulative time that vehicles spend waiting (speed below threshold) while in the simulation. Lower is better. |
| **Units** | seconds (s) |
| **Inputs Required** | Per-vehicle `waitTime` (cumulative time with `speed < waitSpeedThreshold`) |
| **Update Frequency** | Every metric update tick (configurable, default 1 Hz) |
| **Final Aggregation** | Arithmetic mean across all exited vehicles |

**Mathematical Definition:**

$$
\bar{W} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} W_i
$$

Where:
- $N$ = total number of exited vehicles (post-warmup)
- $W_i$ = cumulative wait time of vehicle $i$
- $\text{waitSpeedThreshold}$ = configurable (default 0.5 m/s)

**Running (real-time) value:** Computed over all vehicles that have exited so far. Updated as each vehicle exits.

**Edge Cases:**
- If no vehicles have exited yet, report `0.0`
- If all vehicles pass through without waiting, report `0.0`
- Vehicles still in the simulation are excluded from the final value (but included in a separate "current average" for the running metric)

---

### 2.2 Throughput

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Metric ID** | `throughput` |
| **Description** | Total number of vehicles that have successfully traversed the intersection and exited the simulation. Higher is better. |
| **Units** | vehicles (integer count) |
| **Inputs Required** | Vehicle exit events |
| **Update Frequency** | Every metric update tick |
| **Final Aggregation** | Total count at simulation end |

**Mathematical Definition:**

$$
T = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbb{1}[\text{vehicle}_i \text{ exited}]
$$

**Throughput Rate (rolling):**

$$
T_{\text{rate}} = \frac{T_{\text{window}}}{\Delta t_{\text{window}}} \times 60
$$

Where:
- $T_{\text{window}}$ = vehicles exiting within the rolling window
- $\Delta t_{\text{window}}$ = rolling window duration (configurable, default 60s)
- Result is in vehicles per minute

**Edge Cases:**
- At simulation start, throughput is `0`
- Throughput rate may be `0` during low-traffic periods — this is valid, not an error
- Vehicles that are still in the simulation at completion are NOT counted

---

### 2.3 Queue Length Statistics

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Metric ID** | `queue_length` |
| **Description** | Statistical summary of queue lengths (vehicles waiting on each approach arm). Lower is better. |
| **Units** | vehicles (integer counts) |
| **Inputs Required** | Per-approach count of vehicles with `speed < waitSpeedThreshold` |
| **Update Frequency** | Every metric update tick |
| **Final Aggregation** | Multiple statistics (see below) |

**Mathematical Definition:**

Per approach direction $d$ at time $t$:

$$
Q_d(t) = |\{v : v.\text{direction} = d \wedge v.\text{speed} < \text{threshold} \wedge v.\text{state} \in \{\text{approaching}, \text{waiting}\}\}|
$$

**Aggregated Statistics:**

| Statistic | Formula | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Current queue per direction | $Q_d(t)$ | Instantaneous queue length per approach |
| Average queue length | $\bar{Q} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{d} \bar{Q}_d$ | Mean across all 4 approaches, time-averaged |
| Maximum queue length | $Q_{\max} = \max_{d,t} Q_d(t)$ | Worst queue observed across all directions and times |
| 95th percentile queue | $Q_{95}$ | 95th percentile of all observed queue lengths |

**Edge Cases:**
- Empty approaches have queue length `0`
- During warmup, queues are tracked but not included in final statistics
- If an approach has no vehicles assigned (e.g., `directionalSplit` = 0), its queue is always `0`

---

## 3. Traffic Flow Quality Metrics

### 3.1 Stop Count

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Metric ID** | `stop_count` |
| **Description** | Average number of times a vehicle comes to a complete stop before exiting. Fewer stops indicate smoother flow. Lower is better. |
| **Units** | stops per vehicle (dimensionless) |
| **Inputs Required** | Per-vehicle stop counter (incremented when speed drops below `stopSpeedThreshold` from above it) |
| **Update Frequency** | Every metric update tick |
| **Final Aggregation** | Arithmetic mean across all exited vehicles |

**Mathematical Definition:**

A stop event occurs when vehicle $i$'s speed transitions from $v \geq \theta_{\text{stop}}$ to $v < \theta_{\text{stop}}$:

$$
S_i = \sum_{t} \mathbb{1}[v_i(t-1) \geq \theta_{\text{stop}} \wedge v_i(t) < \theta_{\text{stop}}]
$$

$$
\bar{S} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} S_i
$$

Where:
- $\theta_{\text{stop}}$ = `stopSpeedThreshold` (default 0.1 m/s)
- $N$ = number of exited vehicles (post-warmup)

**Edge Cases:**
- A vehicle that never stops has $S_i = 0$
- A vehicle that arrives at a red light and waits without moving counts as 1 stop (the initial deceleration to zero)
- Repeated oscillations around the threshold should not double-count (use hysteresis or minimum time between counts)

---

### 3.2 Speed Variance Index

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Metric ID** | `speed_variance` |
| **Description** | Coefficient of variation (CV) of vehicle speeds across the simulation, capturing how variable vehicle speeds are. Lower indicates more uniform flow. Lower is better. |
| **Units** | dimensionless (ratio) |
| **Inputs Required** | All vehicle speeds at each metric update tick |
| **Update Frequency** | Every metric update tick |
| **Final Aggregation** | Time-averaged CV |

**Mathematical Definition:**

At each metric update tick $t$, given $M(t)$ active vehicles:

$$
\bar{v}(t) = \frac{1}{M(t)} \sum_{j=1}^{M(t)} v_j(t)
$$

$$
\sigma_v(t) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{M(t)} \sum_{j=1}^{M(t)} (v_j(t) - \bar{v}(t))^2}
$$

$$
\text{CV}(t) = \frac{\sigma_v(t)}{\bar{v}(t)}
$$

$$
\text{SVI} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \text{CV}(t)
$$

Where $T$ = number of metric update ticks (post-warmup).

**Edge Cases:**
- If $\bar{v}(t) = 0$ (all vehicles stopped), CV is undefined. Use $\text{CV}(t) = 0$ in this case (all vehicles have the same speed: zero).
- If fewer than 2 vehicles are active, skip that tick in the average.
- Values typically range from 0 (perfectly uniform) to ~2.0 (highly variable).

---

### 3.3 Travel Time Reliability

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Metric ID** | `travel_time_reliability` |
| **Description** | Planning Time Index (PTI): ratio of the 95th percentile travel time to the median travel time. Measures how much extra time travelers must budget. Closer to 1.0 is better. |
| **Units** | dimensionless (ratio) |
| **Inputs Required** | Per-vehicle total travel time (`exitTime - spawnTime`) |
| **Update Frequency** | Updated each time a vehicle exits |
| **Final Aggregation** | Single ratio computed over all exited vehicles |

**Mathematical Definition:**

Given travel times $\{TT_1, TT_2, \ldots, TT_N\}$ for all $N$ exited vehicles:

$$
\text{PTI} = \frac{TT_{95}}{TT_{50}}
$$

Where:
- $TT_{95}$ = 95th percentile of travel times
- $TT_{50}$ = median (50th percentile) of travel times

**Edge Cases:**
- If fewer than 20 vehicles have exited, the percentile calculation may be unreliable. Report the value but flag it as "low sample size."
- If $TT_{50} = 0$, this indicates a data error (a vehicle cannot have zero travel time). Report `null`.
- A perfectly reliable system has PTI = 1.0. Real-world values are typically 1.5–3.0.

---

## 4. System Performance Metrics

### 4.1 Idle Opportunity Loss

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Metric ID** | `idle_opportunity_loss` |
| **Description** | Fraction of time the intersection capacity is wasted — specifically, time periods where the intersection blocks movement (e.g., red signal) but no vehicles are waiting on the green approach. Applicable primarily to fixed-time signals. Lower is better. |
| **Units** | dimensionless (0 to 1) |
| **Inputs Required** | Signal phase state, queue lengths per approach |
| **Update Frequency** | Every simulation tick |
| **Final Aggregation** | Ratio of idle ticks to total ticks |

**Mathematical Definition:**

For a fixed-time signal at tick $t$:

Let $G(t)$ = set of approaches that currently have green, and $R(t)$ = set of approaches that currently have red.

An "idle opportunity loss" tick occurs when:
- Some approach in $R(t)$ has vehicles waiting ($Q_d(t) > 0$ for some $d \in R(t)$)
- AND all approaches in $G(t)$ have no vehicles ($Q_d(t) = 0$ for all $d \in G(t)$)

$$
\text{IOL} = \frac{\sum_{t} \mathbb{1}[\exists d \in R(t): Q_d(t) > 0 \wedge \forall d' \in G(t): Q_{d'}(t) = 0]}{T_{\text{total}}}
$$

**For roundabouts:** IOL is always `0.0` because roundabouts do not have fixed phases that block movement. Vehicles yield dynamically.

**Edge Cases:**
- During all-red phases, if any approach has vehicles, the tick counts as IOL
- During warmup period, IOL ticks are excluded
- A value of 0.0 means the signal phases are perfectly matched to demand

---

### 4.2 Critical Saturation Volume

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Metric ID** | `critical_saturation_volume` |
| **Description** | The maximum arrival rate (vehicles per second) at which the intersection can still maintain stable queue lengths (queues do not grow unbounded). Higher is better (more capacity). |
| **Units** | vehicles per second (veh/s) |
| **Inputs Required** | Time-averaged throughput rate, time-averaged arrival rate, queue growth trend |
| **Update Frequency** | Calculated at simulation end |
| **Final Aggregation** | Single value |

**Mathematical Definition:**

The saturation volume is estimated by observing queue dynamics:

$$
\text{CSV} \approx \frac{T_{\text{total}}}{t_{\text{effective}}} \times \lambda_{\text{config}}
$$

Where:
- $T_{\text{total}}$ = total throughput (exited vehicles)
- $t_{\text{effective}}$ = simulation duration minus warmup
- $\lambda_{\text{config}}$ = configured arrival rate

**Simplified practical approach:**

If $\text{throughput rate} \geq \text{arrival rate}$ → the system is not saturated at the configured rate.

The CSV is estimated as the arrival rate at which the average queue length growth rate approaches zero:

$$
\text{CSV} = \lambda_{\text{config}} \times \frac{T_{\text{total}}}{V_{\text{spawned}}}
$$

Where $V_{\text{spawned}}$ = total vehicles spawned (post-warmup).

**Edge Cases:**
- If the simulation duration is too short, CSV may be inaccurate. Minimum recommended: 180 seconds post-warmup.
- If the configured arrival rate already saturates the system, CSV = observed throughput rate.
- For roundabouts, capacity depends on circulating flow; CSV should be interpreted carefully.

## 5. Fairness Metrics

### 5.1 Directional Fairness Index

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Metric ID** | `directional_fairness` |
| **Description** | Jain's Fairness Index applied to average wait times across the four approach directions. A value of 1.0 means all directions experience equal wait times. Higher is better. |
| **Units** | dimensionless (0 to 1) |
| **Inputs Required** | Average wait time per direction |
| **Update Frequency** | Every metric update tick |
| **Final Aggregation** | Single value at simulation end |

**Mathematical Definition:**

Given average wait times per direction $\{\bar{W}_{\text{north}}, \bar{W}_{\text{south}}, \bar{W}_{\text{east}}, \bar{W}_{\text{west}}\}$:

$$
J = \frac{\left(\sum_{d=1}^{4} \bar{W}_d\right)^2}{4 \cdot \sum_{d=1}^{4} \bar{W}_d^2}
$$

This is Jain's Fairness Index for 4 users (directions).

**Properties:**
- $J = 1.0$: All directions have equal average wait time (perfectly fair)
- $J = 0.25$: Only one direction has non-zero wait time (maximally unfair for 4 directions)
- Range: $[1/n, 1]$ where $n = 4$

**Edge Cases:**
- If all directions have $\bar{W}_d = 0$ (no waiting), $J = 1.0$ (perfectly fair)
- If a direction has no vehicles (e.g., `directionalSplit` = 0), exclude it from the calculation and adjust $n$
- For symmetric configurations (equal arrival rates, equal green times), $J$ should be very close to 1.0

---

## 6. Physical Constraints Metrics

### 6.1 Space / Footprint Consumed

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Metric ID** | `footprint` |
| **Description** | Total land area consumed by the intersection infrastructure. This is a static metric determined by geometry, not by simulation dynamics. Lower is better (more land-efficient). |
| **Units** | square meters (m²) |
| **Inputs Required** | Intersection geometry from configuration |
| **Update Frequency** | Computed once at simulation initialization |
| **Final Aggregation** | Single value |

**Mathematical Definition:**

**Fixed-Time Signal:**

The footprint is the area of the intersection box formed by the crossing lanes:

$$
A_{\text{signal}} = (n_{\text{NS}} \times w_{\text{lane}}) \times (n_{\text{EW}} \times w_{\text{lane}})
$$

Where:
- $n_{\text{NS}}$ = total lanes on North + South approaches (both directions)
- $n_{\text{EW}}$ = total lanes on East + West approaches (both directions)
- $w_{\text{lane}}$ = lane width

For 2 lanes per approach: $A = (2 \times 2 \times 3.5) \times (2 \times 2 \times 3.5) = 14 \times 14 = 196 \text{ m}^2$

> **Note on asymmetric lane counts:** this formula assumes $n_{\text{NS}}$ and $n_{\text{EW}}$ are known per direction. The versioned configuration contract currently only supports a single scalar `lanesPerApproach` shared by all four approaches (see [06-scenario-configuration-contract.md](06-scenario-configuration-contract.md#24-roads--road-configuration)), in which case $n_{\text{NS}} = n_{\text{EW}} = 2 \times \text{lanesPerApproach}$ and this formula matches `calculate_space_footprint_consumed()`. Per-direction asymmetric lane counts are accepted only by the internal live-dashboard representation, where `calculate_space_footprint_consumed()` instead approximates the area from the largest single approach rather than applying this formula. Reconciling this formula with true per-direction asymmetry is planned future work, contingent on asymmetric lanes becoming an officially supported configuration (see the note above).

**Roundabout:**

The footprint is the area of the outer circle:

$$
A_{\text{roundabout}} = \pi \times r_{\text{outer}}^2
$$

For $r_{\text{outer}} = 20$m: $A = \pi \times 400 \approx 1256.6 \text{ m}^2$

**Edge Cases:**
- Footprint does not change during simulation — it is constant
- For comparison purposes, include the approach taper areas if significantly different between designs
- This metric provides context: roundabouts use more land but may provide better flow

---

## 7. Ancillary / Derived Metrics

These metrics are genuinely emitted by `MetricCollector.get_metrics()` (see §9's output schema) but are not part of the primary 10-metric registry in §8's summary table — they are secondary/derived statistics that were previously undocumented. Definitions below are transcribed directly from the current implementation (`backend/src/metrics/collector.py`, `backend/src/metrics/efficiency.py`, `backend/src/metrics/definitions/derived_metrics.py`); none are new or changed by this section.

### 7.1 Master Efficiency Score

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Output key** | `masterEfficiencyScore` |
| **Description** | A single weighted composite score summarizing overall intersection performance, for at-a-glance comparison between designs. |
| **Units** | dimensionless, 0.0–100.0 |
| **Direction** | Higher ↑ |
| **Running?** | ✅ (recomputed every `get_metrics()` call from that call's own other metric values) |
| **Implementation** | `calculate_master_efficiency_score()` in `backend/src/metrics/efficiency.py` |

**Mathematical Definition:**

$$
\text{Score} = 30 \cdot \text{tp\_norm} + 25 \cdot \text{wait\_norm} + 15 \cdot \text{stops\_norm} + 20 \cdot \text{fairness\_norm} + 10 \cdot \text{idle\_norm}
$$

Where, given `throughputRate` (veh/min), `averageWaitTime` (s), `averageStopsPerVehicle`, `directionalFairnessIndex`, and `idleOpportunityLoss` from the same metrics snapshot:
- $\text{tp\_norm} = \min(1, \frac{\text{throughputRate}/60}{2.0})$ — normalized against a 2.0 veh/s (120 veh/min) ceiling
- $\text{wait\_norm} = \max(0, 1 - \frac{\text{averageWaitTime}}{60})$ — 1.0 at 0s wait, 0.0 at ≥60s
- $\text{stops\_norm} = \max(0, 1 - \frac{\text{averageStopsPerVehicle}}{5})$ — 1.0 at 0 stops, 0.0 at ≥5 stops
- $\text{fairness\_norm} = \text{clamp}(\text{directionalFairnessIndex}, 0, 1)$
- $\text{idle\_norm} = \max(0, 1 - \text{idleOpportunityLoss})$

Result is rounded to 1 decimal place. Safe for the zero-vehicle case: every input metric already defaults to a well-defined value (e.g. `directionalFairnessIndex` defaults to 1.0, `idleOpportunityLoss`/`averageWaitTime`/`averageStopsPerVehicle` default to 0.0) with no vehicles active, so the score is always computable.

### 7.2 Queue Stability Index

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Output key** | `queueStabilityIndex` |
| **Description** | Coefficient of variation of total intersection-wide queue length over time — how erratically the queue fluctuates relative to its own average, independent of scale. |
| **Units** | dimensionless |
| **Direction** | Lower ↓ (a stable, predictable queue) |
| **Running?** | ✅ |
| **Implementation** | `calculate_queue_stability_index()` in `backend/src/metrics/definitions/derived_metrics.py` |

**Mathematical Definition:**

$$
\text{QSI} = \frac{\sigma(Q_t)}{\bar{Q}_t}
$$

Where $Q_t$ is the total queue length (summed across all four approaches) at post-warmup tick $t$, $\sigma$ is the sample standard deviation, and $\bar{Q}_t$ is the mean. Returns `0.0` if fewer than 2 post-warmup ticks have elapsed, or if the mean queue length is exactly 0 (avoids division by zero). Rounded to 3 decimal places.

### 7.3 Intersection Utilization

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Output key** | `intersectionUtilization` |
| **Description** | Percentage of post-warmup ticks with at least one active vehicle during which the average active-vehicle speed exceeded the "waiting" threshold — a proxy for how much of the demand period the intersection was actually flowing rather than stopped. |
| **Units** | percent, 0.0–100.0 |
| **Direction** | Context-dependent — neither higher nor lower is unconditionally better; very low values indicate under-utilization, values near 100 with high queue metrics indicate saturation. |
| **Running?** | ✅ |
| **Implementation** | `MetricCollector.get_metrics()`, using `self.service_ticks` / `self.demand_ticks` accumulated in `update()` |

**Mathematical Definition:**

$$
U = \begin{cases} \dfrac{\text{service\_ticks}}{\text{demand\_ticks}} \times 100 & \text{demand\_ticks} > 0 \\ 0 & \text{demand\_ticks} = 0 \end{cases}
$$

`demand_ticks` counts post-warmup ticks with ≥1 active vehicle; `service_ticks` counts the subset of those where the average active-vehicle speed exceeds `vehicleGeneration.waitSpeedThreshold`. Rounded to 1 decimal place.

### 7.4 Congestion Recovery Time

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Output key** | `congestionRecoveryTime` |
| **Description** | Total simulated time spent in a congested state, defined as total intersection-wide queue length exceeding 5 vehicles. |
| **Units** | seconds |
| **Direction** | Lower ↓ |
| **Running?** | ✅ |
| **Implementation** | `MetricCollector.update()` / `get_metrics()` |

**Mathematical Definition:**

$$
T_{\text{recovery}} = \sum_{t \,:\, Q_t > 5} \Delta t
$$

Accumulated post-warmup only, incrementing by `simulation.timeStep` on every tick where total queue length across all four approaches exceeds 5 vehicles. Rounded to 2 decimal places. The `5` threshold is a fixed constant in the implementation, not currently configurable.

### 7.5 Active Average Queue Length

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Output key** | `activeAverageQueueLength` |
| **Description** | Mean total intersection-wide queue length, computed only over ticks where a queue actually existed (total queue > 0) — distinct from `averageQueueLength` (§2.3), which is the mean of per-direction time-averages including zero-queue ticks. |
| **Units** | vehicles |
| **Direction** | Lower ↓ |
| **Running?** | ✅ |
| **Implementation** | `MetricCollector.get_metrics()` |

**Mathematical Definition:**

$$
\overline{Q}_{\text{active}} = \frac{1}{|\{t : Q_t > 0\}|} \sum_{t \,:\, Q_t > 0} Q_t
$$

Returns `0.0` if no post-warmup tick ever had a nonzero total queue. Rounded to 2 decimal places.

### 7.6 Queue Standard Deviation

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Output key** | `queueStdDev` |
| **Description** | Sample standard deviation of total intersection-wide queue length across all post-warmup ticks (including zero-queue ticks) — the un-normalized companion to `queueStabilityIndex` (§7.2). |
| **Units** | vehicles |
| **Direction** | Lower ↓ |
| **Running?** | ✅ |
| **Implementation** | `MetricCollector.get_metrics()` |

**Mathematical Definition:**

$$
\sigma(Q_t) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_t (Q_t - \bar{Q}_t)^2}
$$

Returns `0.0` if fewer than 2 post-warmup ticks have elapsed. Rounded to 2 decimal places.

### 7.7 Collision Count

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Output key** | `collisionCount` |
| **Description** | Running total of debounced collision events detected by the post-hoc Separating Axis Theorem overlap audit — one event per overlapping vehicle-pair, counted once on the tick the overlap begins, not once per tick it persists (see `VehiclePool._collision_audit()`). This is a deterministic count of a real, already-tracked safety-net event, not a probability or rate — see [Remaining collision-audit limitations](#remaining-collision-audit-limitations) below. |
| **Units** | count (integer) |
| **Direction** | Lower ↓ (0 is the only fully safe value) |
| **Running?** | ✅ |
| **Implementation** | `VehiclePool.collision_count` (pool.py), passed into `MetricCollector.get_metrics(..., collision_count=...)` by each caller (`backend/src/main.py`, `backend/src/snapshot/builder.py`, `backend/src/study/volume_sweep.py`) |

**Definition:** the exact value of `VehiclePool.collision_count` at the moment `get_metrics()` is called — no additional transformation, rate, or normalization is applied. Always `0` for a simulation with no detected overlaps, including the zero-vehicle case, since the underlying counter starts at `0` and is only ever incremented.

<a id="remaining-collision-audit-limitations"></a>**Remaining collision-audit limitations (not addressed by exposing this count):** the audit is reactive/post-hoc — it detects and freezes already-overlapping vehicles, it does not prevent collisions. No predictive rate or probability is derived from this count because the normalization convention (per vehicle? per minute? per 100 vehicles?) is an undecided product choice, not a data limitation — see the roundabout conflict-architecture investigation notes for related context on the current safety-net's known gaps.

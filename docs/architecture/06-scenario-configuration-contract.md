## 1. Overview

A **Scenario Configuration** is a JSON document that fully describes a simulation run before it begins. It specifies:

- How long to simulate
- What type of intersection controller to use
- How many vehicles to generate and how
- Road geometry and lane configuration
- Physics parameters
- Which metrics to collect
- Visualization preferences

The versioned API accepts this configuration over REST and validates it against `shared/schemas/config.schema.json`. The dashboard's compact `/api/simulation/config` payload is expanded by `backend/src/main.py`; it is documented separately in [../operations.md](../operations.md).

### Design Principles

1. **Complete** — Every parameter needed to reproduce a simulation run is in the config
2. **Defaulted** — Every field has a sensible default; minimal configs are valid
3. **Validated** — JSON Schema validation catches errors before simulation starts
4. **Deterministic** — Same config + same random seed = identical results

## 2. Configuration Sections

### 2.1 `simulation` — Simulation Parameters

| # | Field | Type | Required | Default | Description | Validation |
|---|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | `duration` | `number` | ❌ | `300` | Total simulation duration | > 0, ≤ 3600 seconds |
| 2 | `timeStep` | `number` | ❌ | `0.1` | Simulation tick interval (dt) | > 0, ≤ 1.0 seconds |
| 3 | `warmupTime` | `number` | ❌ | `30` | Initial period excluded from all metrics — vehicles still approaching the intersection during this window (not yet interacting with it) are excluded from averages so they don't distort them. Enforced by a single early-return in `MetricCollector.update()`, so every per-tick-accumulated metric (queues, delay, throughput, speed variance, idle loss, etc.) is excluded consistently. Not the same as `controller.offset` (§2.6.1), which is a signal-timing concept, not an analysis one. | ≥ 0, < `duration` |
| 4 | `randomSeed` | `integer` | ❌ | `42` | Random number generator seed | ≥ 0 |
| 5 | `snapshotFrequency` | `number` | ❌ | `10` | Snapshots emitted per second | > 0, ≤ 60 Hz |

### 2.2 `traffic` — Traffic Demand

| # | Field | Type | Required | Default | Description | Validation |
|---|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | `totalVehicles` | `integer` | ❌ | `200` | Maximum vehicles to generate | > 0, ≤ 5000 |
| 2 | `arrivalRate` | `number` | ❌ | `0.5` | Mean vehicles arriving per second (Poisson) | > 0, ≤ 10.0 veh/s |
| 3 | `arrivalDistribution` | `string` | ❌ | `"poisson"` | Arrival process type | enum: `poisson`, `uniform`, `burst` |
| 4 | `directionalSplit` | `object` | ❌ | See below | Fraction of vehicles from each direction | Values sum to 1.0 |
| 5 | `turnProbabilities` | `object` | ❌ | See below | Turn intent probabilities | Values sum to 1.0 per direction |

#### Default `directionalSplit`
```json
{
  "north": 0.25,
  "south": 0.25,
  "east": 0.25,
  "west": 0.25
}
```

#### Default `turnProbabilities`
```json
{
  "left": 0.2,
  "straight": 0.6,
  "right": 0.2
}
```

### 2.3 `geometry` — Intersection Geometry

| # | Field | Type | Required | Default | Description | Validation |
|---|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | `intersectionType` | `string` | ✅ | — | Type of intersection | enum: `fixed_time_signal`, `roundabout` |
| 2 | `intersectionCenter` | `object` | ❌ | `{"x": 0, "y": 0}` | Center coordinates | — |

### 2.4 `roads` — Road Configuration

| # | Field | Type | Required | Default | Description | Validation |
|---|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | `approachLength` | `number` | ❌ | `200` | Length of each approach arm | > 50, ≤ 1000 meters |
| 2 | `laneWidth` | `number` | ❌ | `3.5` | Width of each lane | > 2.5, ≤ 5.0 meters |
| 3 | `lanesPerApproach` | `integer` | ❌ | `2` | Lane count applied to all four approaches | 1–4 (see `shared/schemas/config.schema.json`) |
| 4 | `speedLimit` | `number` | ❌ | `13.89` | Speed limit on approach roads | > 0, ≤ 30 m/s (≈108 km/h) |
| 5 | `approaches` | `array<ApproachConfig>` | ❌ | All 4 directions | Per-approach overrides | See below |

> **Asymmetric lane counts — not yet part of this contract.** The versioned config schema (`shared/schemas/config.schema.json`, enforced on `POST /api/v1/configs/validate` and `POST /api/v1/simulations`) only accepts `lanesPerApproach` as a single integer shared by all four approaches. Internally, the legacy live dashboard routes (`backend/src/main.py`) and the simulation engine (`backend/src/roads/network.py`) already accept a per-direction object (`{"north": 2, "south": 3, ...}`), but that shape is an implementation detail of the live/interactive path, not a validated or documented versioned-API feature. Officially supporting asymmetric per-direction lane counts in the versioned contract — including the schema, Pydantic models, and any dependent metric formulas such as [Space/Footprint Consumed](07-metric-contract.md#61-space--footprint-consumed) — is planned future work, not current behavior.

#### ApproachConfig Object

| # | Field | Type | Required | Default | Description | Validation |
|---|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | `direction` | `string` | ✅ | — | Approach direction | enum: `north`, `south`, `east`, `west` |
| 2 | `lanes` | `integer` | ❌ | Inherits from `lanesPerApproach` | Lane count for this approach | ≥ 1, ≤ 4 |
| 3 | `speedLimit` | `number` | ❌ | Inherits from `roads.speedLimit` | Speed limit for this approach | > 0 m/s |

### 2.5 `vehicleGeneration` — Vehicle Properties

| # | Field | Type | Required | Default | Description | Validation |
|---|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | `vehicleLength` | `object` | ❌ | `{"min": 4.0, "max": 5.0}` | Vehicle length range | min > 0, max ≥ min |
| 2 | `vehicleWidth` | `object` | ❌ | `{"min": 1.8, "max": 2.2}` | Vehicle width range | min > 0, max ≥ min |
| 3 | `desiredSpeed` | `object` | ❌ | `{"min": 11.0, "max": 15.0}` | Desired free-flow speed range | min > 0, max ≥ min, m/s |

| 8 | `idmDelta` | `number` | ❌ | `4` | IDM acceleration exponent | > 0 |

### 2.6 `controller` — Controller-Specific Configuration

Uses a discriminated union based on `geometry.intersectionType`.

#### 2.6.1 Fixed-Time Signal Controller

Every duration below has a **canonical** field name (matching `FixedTimeSignalController`'s own naming, and the legacy live-dashboard config path) and, for three of them, one or two **legacy alias** field names retained for backward compatibility. All are accepted by both `shared/schemas/config.schema.json` and the typed `ControllerSection` Pydantic model (used by `POST /api/simulation/new`) — a canonical field is no longer silently dropped by the typed path the way it previously was when only the alias names were declared.

| # | Field | Type | Required | Default | Description | Validation |
|---|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | `straightRightDuration` (canonical) / `greenDuration` / `greenTime` (aliases) | `number` | ❌ | `30` | Green phase duration for the straight+right movement of each direction | > 5, ≤ 120 seconds |
| 2 | `leftDuration` | `number` | ❌ | `5` | Protected left-turn green phase duration. **Applies only to the default cycle** — see the note below §2.6.1 | > 0, ≤ 60 seconds |
| 3 | `yellowDuration` (canonical) / `yellowTime` (alias) | `number` | ❌ | `4` | Yellow (amber) phase duration | > 2, ≤ 8 seconds |
| 4 | `allRedDuration` (canonical) / `allRedTime` (alias) | `number` | ❌ | `2` | All-red clearance interval | ≥ 0, ≤ 5 seconds |
| 5 | `phaseSequence` | `array<string>` | ❌ | `["ns_green", "ns_yellow", "all_red", "ew_green", "ew_yellow", "all_red"]` | Ordered phase sequence | See below |
| 6 | `offset` | `number` | ❌ | `0` | Signal phase-coordination offset — shifts the initial phase cursor at simulation start (e.g. for multi-intersection green-wave coordination). **Not** a metrics/analysis warm-up period — see [08-communication-contract.md](08-communication-contract.md) and `simulation.warmupTime` (§2.1) for that. | ≥ 0 seconds |

**Alias precedence** (when more than one name for the same duration is present in one config, `FixedTimeSignalController.__init__` resolves them in this order, highest priority first — later-checked aliases overwrite earlier ones if the canonical field is absent):
- Green: `straightRightDuration` > `greenTime` > `greenDuration`
- Yellow: `yellowDuration` > `yellowTime`
- All-red: `allRedDuration` > `allRedTime`
- Left: `leftDuration` only — no alias exists for this field.

> **`leftDuration` applies only to the default cycle.** It sets the protected
> left-turn green in the one-direction-at-a-time cycle the controller builds
> when `phaseSequence` is **omitted entirely**. A configured `phaseSequence`
> has no protected-left phase — permissive lefts during a paired green are
> arbitrated by the conflict layer instead — so `leftDuration` has no effect
> whenever `phaseSequence` is present. Because `phaseSequence` carries its own
> default (the paired NS/EW plan above), any config validated through the
> schema or `ScenarioConfiguration` receives that default and therefore does
> **not** use `leftDuration`. Setting it alongside a `phaseSequence` is
> accepted and harmless, but changes nothing. The field is conditionally
> applicable rather than dead: it is the only way to tune the default cycle's
> protected left, which is still reachable by omitting `phaseSequence` when
> constructing `FixedTimeSignalController` directly.

If none of a duration's names are present, the hardcoded fallback (30 / 5 / 4 / 2 above) is used — chosen to match the canonical/alias defaults exactly, so the effective duration is the same regardless of which alias (or none) a given config uses.

**`phaseSequence` vocabulary:** each entry is either the literal string `"all_red"`, or `"<group>_<green|yellow>"` where `<group>` is one of `n`, `s`, `e`, `w` (a single approach) or `ns`/`sn`, `ew`/`we` (a paired, order-invariant approach group sharing one green — e.g. `ns_green` runs NORTH and SOUTH together). Green-phase duration uses `straightRightDuration` (after alias resolution above); yellow-phase duration uses `yellowDuration`; `all_red` uses `allRedDuration`. During a paired-group green phase, all three turn intents (including permissive left) are allowed for both directions in the group — left-turners crossing opposing straight traffic are arbitrated by `ConflictManager` (see [08-communication-contract.md](08-communication-contract.md)), not by a separate protected-left sub-phase. An entry that doesn't match this vocabulary raises a configuration error surfaced as `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` by `POST /api/v1/simulations` and `POST /api/simulation/new`. When `phaseSequence` is omitted entirely, the controller instead builds its original one-direction-at-a-time cycle (straight+right green → protected left green → yellow → all-red, repeated for N→S→E→W) — see the note on default-consistency below.

#### 2.6.2 Roundabout Controller

| # | Field | Type | Required | Default | Description | Validation |
|---|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | `innerRadius` | `number` | ❌ | `10` | Inner radius of the circulatory roadway | > 5, ≤ 50 meters |
| 2 | `outerRadius` | `number` | ❌ | `20` | Outer radius of the circulatory roadway | > `innerRadius` |
| 3 | `circulatingLanes` | `integer` | ❌ | `1` | **Reserved / future-only** — see note below | ≥ 1, ≤ 3 |
| 4 | `criticalGap` | `number` | ❌ | `4.0` | Minimum acceptable gap for entry | > 0, ≤ 10 seconds |
| 5 | `followUpTime` | `number` | ❌ | `2.5` | Time between consecutive entering vehicles | > 0 seconds |
| 6 | `entrySpeed` | `number` | ❌ | `5.0` | Maximum speed at roundabout entry | > 0 m/s |
| 7 | `circulatingSpeed` | `number` | ❌ | `8.0` | Speed cap on the circulating roadway — see the speed-regime note below | > 0, ≤ 15 m/s |

> **Speed regime through a roundabout.** The three speed parameters apply in
> sequence, and each is a cap rather than a target: `entrySpeed` over the
> approach, `circulatingSpeed` on the circulating roadway, and the vehicle's own
> desired speed once it reaches the exit lane.
>
> `circulatingSpeed` genuinely constrains the ring, and must: it is what keeps
> cornering physically possible. On the default 10-20 m geometry the ring radii
> are 12.5-17.5 m, so 8 m/s implies a lateral acceleration of about
> 3.7-5.1 m/s², within what a vehicle's tyres and its occupants tolerate. It is
> also the speed that `criticalGap` is judged against at the give-way line, so
> raising it without raising `criticalGap` will make entry decisions optimistic.
>
> Measured saturation capacity with these defaults is about 1400 veh/h for a
> single-lane ring, which sits in the published range for a single-lane
> roundabout (roughly 1200-1400 veh/h). The defaults are therefore calibrated;
> the fixed-time signal side is not (see
> [09-engineering-standards.md](09-engineering-standards.md) if a comparison
> study is being planned, and validate the signal's capacity curve first).

> **`circulatingLanes` is reserved / future-only — it has no runtime effect today.** The value is accepted and schema-validated, and `RoundaboutController` stores it, but nothing in the engine ever reads it back out. The circulating lane count a roundabout actually uses is derived entirely from `roads.lanesPerApproach` (each approach's own incoming lane count doubles as its circulating lane count in `backend/src/roads/network.py` and `backend/src/controllers/roundabout.py`) — approach lanes, circulating lane indices, connection lanes, and exit lanes are all coupled through that one value, with no independent ring-lane-count path anywhere in the current implementation. `circulatingLanes` is being kept in the schema and Pydantic model (not removed or deprecated) because it is expected to become necessary once asymmetric `lanesPerApproach` (see §2.4 above) reaches roundabouts — a single ring can only have one physical lane count, independent of any one approach's lane count, so an asymmetric-lanes roundabout will need a real, independent ring-lane-count parameter. Making it functional will require explicit future design decisions for ring geometry and the approach-lane → ring-lane mapping; none of that exists yet.

| # | Field | Type | Required | Default | Description | Validation |
|---|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|------------|

| 5 | `stopSpeedThreshold` | `number` | ❌ | `0.1` | Speed below which a vehicle is "stopped" | ≥ 0 m/s |

| 3 | `pixelsPerMeter` | `number` | ❌ | `3.0` | Rendering scale factor | > 0 |
| 4 | `showVehicleIds` | `boolean` | ❌ | `false` | Display vehicle IDs on canvas | — |

`controller.circulatingLanes` in the example above (`1`) is reserved / future-only (see §2.6.2) — it is included because it is schema-valid and accepted, not because setting it changes simulation behavior. This roundabout's actual circulating lane count comes from `roads.lanesPerApproach` (also `1`, above).

  }
}
```

All other fields use their documented defaults.

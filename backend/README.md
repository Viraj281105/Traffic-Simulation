# Simulation Backend & Engine

The simulation backend is a Python 3.11+ FastAPI application. It features a discrete-time simulation engine using the **Intelligent Driver Model (IDM)**, fixed-time signal and roundabout controllers, live metric collection, SQLite-backed study persistence, REST routes, and WebSocket snapshot streams. The complete current API workflow is in [../docs/operations.md](../docs/operations.md).

**Owner:** Viraj Jadhao (Simulation/Data)
**Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, SQLite, Pytest

## Core Simulation Submodules

### 1. Physics Modeling (IDM)

The longitudinal vehicle kinematics are governed by the **Intelligent Driver Model (IDM)**, which updates vehicle speed $v$ and position $x$ dynamically at each step:
$$\frac{dv}{dt} = a \left[ 1 - \left(\frac{v}{v_0}\right)^\delta - \left(\frac{s^*(v, \Delta v)}{s}\right)^2 \right]$$
Where:

- $v_0$ is the desired speed.
- $s$ is the actual distance to the leading vehicle.
- $s^*(v, \Delta v) = s_0 + v T + \frac{v \Delta v}{2\sqrt{a b}}$ is the dynamic desired spacing.
- $a$ is maximum acceleration, and $b$ is comfortable deceleration.

### 2. Intersection Controllers

- **Fixed-Time Signal Control (`fixed_time_signal.py`)**: Rotates through standard phases (`NS_Green` -> `NS_Yellow` -> `AllRed` -> `EW_Green` -> `EW_Yellow` -> `AllRed`) utilizing predefined time offsets.
- **Roundabout Control (`roundabout.py`)**: Models yield-at-entry circular gap acceptance. Vehicles check circulating traffic spacing and speed before committing to cross the entry line.

### 3. Snapshot Builder & Dual Orchestrator

- **State Snapshots**: Periodically captures the physical coordinates, velocities, and light statuses at 10Hz and validates the output against `shared/schemas/snapshot.schema.json`.
- **Dual Simulation**: Runs Fixed-Time and Roundabout engines concurrently with the same configured seed for comparative experiments; the engines are stepped independently rather than under a strict lockstep scheduler.

---

## Database Schema & Volume Sweep Runs

The database is built on SQLite (`simulation.db`) using raw SQL scripts managed by `DAO`:

- **`configurations` Table**: Stores validated configuration JSON models.
- **`simulation_runs` Table**: Records metadata (seed, controller type, status, simulation time, duration).
- **`run_metrics` Table**: Keeps historical logs of the 10 performance metrics.

### Automated Volume Sweep

To perform a sensitivity analysis across arrival rates, call the study API
(implemented in `src/study/volume_sweep.py`):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/study/sweeps/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"arrivalRates": [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7]}'
```

This stores all resulting metrics back to SQLite (`sweep_sessions` and
`simulation_runs`) for comparisons, and the session can be retrieved later
via `GET /api/v1/study/sweeps/{sessionId}`.

## Setup & Execution Guide

### Local Installation

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Initialize virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
   # source .venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
   ```
3. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Execution

Run the FastAPI Web API:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API becomes available at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive API Docs are served at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Testing

Execute the whole suite — nothing is excluded by default:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Tests carrying the `slow` marker are the full-strength simulation sweeps in
`tests/integration/test_signal_capacity.py` and
`tests/integration/test_roundabout_conflicts.py`: multi-seed, multi-lane and
multi-demand regressions where every case is a complete 120-240 s simulation.
They dominate wall time, so CI splits them off rather than running them on
every push:

```bash
# What the "Backend CI" job runs on every PR/push. Includes the conflict
# geometry pins and a single-seed representative of each sweep.
python -m pytest -m "not slow"

# What the "Backend Slow Simulation Regression" job runs nightly, and what
# you can trigger by hand from the Actions tab. Run this before a release.
python -m pytest -m slow
```

The sweeps are selected away in the fast job, never weakened or skipped, and
`python -m pytest` with no marker filter remains the complete run.
